# Welcome to Gold Port

The golden age of Gold Port is fading. Once a thriving port of trade, the city now reels from relentless pirate raids and bandit ambushes, its markets empty and streets anxious. And so the city has turned to outsiders—you, a band of mercenaries—for help. But as you take the job, whispers spread through the city: some say the pirates are former sailors betrayed by their lord, others claim the bandits have a secret backer. In Gold Port, nothing is as simple as it seems.
